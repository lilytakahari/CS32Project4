## UCLA CS 32 Winter 2019 Project 4 - Gee-nomics

This program processes genetic data. It maintains a library of genomes (in memory) from multiple organisms; the user can add new genomes to this library. The user can then search the library for a specified DNA sequence and identify all genomes in the library that contain that DNA sequence or any SNiP of it. The user can also present the genome/DNA of a new organism and quickly identify all genomes in the library that have a high percentage of matching DNA with the presented genome.

My implementation of what was required in the spec is contained in the `Trie.h, Genome.cpp`, and `GenomeMatcher.cpp` files; I cannot say for sure whether or not my implementation is free of bugs.

### How to Run the Program
Download the `skeleton.zip` file. Replace `Trie.h, Genome.cpp`, and `GenomeMatcher.cpp` with the files above. Build the program and run the executable (from the command line if necessary).
