## UCLA CS 32 Winter 2019 Project 4 - Gee-nomics

This program processes genetic data. It maintains a library of genomes (in memory) from multiple organisms; the user can add new genomes to this library. The user can then search the library for a specified DNA sequence and identify all genomes in the library that contain that DNA sequence or any SNiP of it. The user can also present the genome/DNA of a new organism and quickly identify all genomes in the library that have a high percentage of matching DNA
with the presented genome.
